# Design


Initial mindmap on UI/UX and security can be found
[here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOXWhwDI=/?invite_link_id=329221243578).

## Setting Up

To initialise the database run:

```
make setup
```


## Starting the Server

```
make server
```

To start the server with an interactive IEx session for debugging:

```
make console
```

The server will be exposed on 8080 by default.
Navigate to http://localhost:8080

## Running the tests

Run:

```
make test
```

## Docker

The application is configured so that it can be started through Docker.
This is for ease of reviewing. Running in Docker is slower though,
especially on Mac. The provided docker-compose file can be used to start
a Postgres database which be used even when the tests or the dev server is
started outside Docker.

Example: Running the tests connected to Docker Postgres

```
docker-compose up --detach postgres

mix test
```
